# Oware 

Oware is an abstract strategy game among the bigger Mancala family of board games (or Pit and Pebbles Games) played all over the world with slight variations across different societies with regard to distribution area, number of players and strategy of play. 

The game requires an oware board and 48 seeds. A typical oware board has two straight rows of six pits, called "houses", and optionally one large "score" house at either end. Each player controls the six houses on their side of the board, and the score house on their end. The game begins with four seeds in each of the twelve smaller houses.
